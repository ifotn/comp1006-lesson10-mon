Video Game PHP Application after Week 9

This application covers the work we have done in the first 9 weeks of class, including:

    Saving Data
    Reading Data
    Updating Data
    Deleting Data
    Input Validation
    Twitter Bootstrap for CSS
    Adding Authentication Requirements
    Creating a Shared Header and Footer
    Incorporating Error Handling

In the upcoming weeks we will extend this application in the following ways:

    Adding File Uploads
    Search
    Comments and other 3rd Party Functionality

Please note these files use my own local database connection so this would need to be changed to work with your own database.
